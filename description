DR is a severe eye condition affecting most patients after 10â€“15 years of diabetes, often leading to vision loss.
Manual screening is labor-intensive, inconsistent, and limited by specialist availability.
CNN-based automated systems can learn DR indicators directly from fundus images, enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable detection and severity classification.
